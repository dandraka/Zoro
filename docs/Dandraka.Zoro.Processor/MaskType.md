# MaskType enumeration

Sets the type of masking done to a field.

```csharp
public enum MaskType
```

## Values

| name | value | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | `0` | The field contents are not masked. This is the default. |
| Similar | `1` | The field contents are substituted with different content, e.g. a different name or post code. |
| Asterisk | `2` | The field contents are substituted with a character, e.g. asterisks or spaces. |
| Expression | `3` | The field contents are substituted with a combination of a constant string and values from other fields. The FieldMask.Expression field is mandatory and must be filled with a constant string and field names enclosed in double curly brackets. For example "Customer-{{CustomerID}}" (without the quotes). When the data source is Json, a JsonPath is expected in the place of field name. The JsonPath will be applied on the root of the Json. For example "Customer-{{$.CustomerID}}" (without the quotes). |
| List | `4` | The field contents are substituted with a randomly picked item of a given list. |
| Query | `5` | The field contents are substituted with a randomly picked item from the result of q query. The query must return only one field. |
